# ormucoTest

- [x] Display a form that accepts three fields as input: "Name", "Favorite Color", "Cats or Dogs". Ensure that "Name" is unique.
- [ ] Create an Ansible playbook to deploy it on a cloud
- [ ] Bonus points if the application can be easily scaled beyond a single server. More bonus points if the server is well secured (HTTPS, firewalls, etc).

- Inside the `ormuco` directory run `manage.py` by writting: `python manage.py run`
